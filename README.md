# Renewable-Energy-Consumption
This repo contains my solution including wrangling, cleaning, and visualization to the Tableau Student Vizard Challenge.

The Tableau Student Vizard Challenge is a challenge for students doing Data Analyis and Visualization using Tableau.

## My Workflow and Approach to this Challenge
- Get the Data (WorldBank-Renewable Energy Consumption (SVZ2022)).
- Assess the data for quality and tidyness issues.
- Clean the data according to the issues found.
- Save cleaned data into a csv file (WorldBank Renewable Energy Consumption)
- Visualize using Tableau.
